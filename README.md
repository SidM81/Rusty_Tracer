# Rusty Ray Tracer

## Description

Rusty Ray Tracer is a ray tracing renderer implemented in Rust. It simulates the behavior of light as it interacts with objects in a scene, producing realistic images by tracing the path of rays of light. This project serves as an educational tool to understand the principles of ray tracing and computer graphics.

## Features

- **Ray Tracing**: Utilizes ray tracing techniques to generate images.
- **Scene Description**: Supports defining custom scenes with various objects, materials, and lighting setups.
- **Parallel Processing**: Utilizes Rust's concurrency features for efficient parallel processing.
- **Configurable Parameters**: Allows users to adjust rendering parameters such as resolution, field of view, and sample count.
- **Output Formats**: Supports exporting images in common formats such as PNG and JPEG.
